/*
 *  JSON_DEBUG is used to perform extra error checking.  Because libjson usually 
 *  does on the fly parsing, validation is impossible, so this option will allow
 *  you to register an error callback so that you can record what is going wrong 
 *  before the library crashes.  This option does not protect from these errors,
 *  it simply tells you about them, which is nice for debugging, but not preferable
 *  for release candidates
 */
//#define JSON_DEBUG


/*
 *  JSON_ISO_STRICT turns off all code that uses non-standard C++.  This removes all
 *  references to long long and long double as well as a few others
 */

/*
 *  JSON_SAFE performs similarly to JSON_DEBUG, except this option does protect

 *  messages in the console
 */

/*
 *  JSON_PREPARSE causes all parsing to be done immediately.  By default, libjson
 *  parses nodes on the fly as they are needed, this makes parsing much faster if
 *  your program gets a lot of information that it doesn't need.  An example of
 *  this would be a client application communicating with a server if the server
 *  returns things like last modified date and other things that you don't use.
 */

/*
 *  JSON_LESS_MEMORY will force libjson to let go of memory as quickly as it can
 *  this is recommended for software that has to run on less than optimal machines.
 *  It will cut libjson's memory usage by about 20%, but also run slightly slower.
 *  It's recommended that you also compile using the -Os option, as this will also
 *  reduce the size of the library
 */

 *  means that libjson supports the full array of unicode characters, but also takes

 *  that some users would like to further add speed by having the library utilize a memory
 *  pool.  With this option turned on, the default behavior is still done internally unless
 *  a callback is registered.  So you can have this option on and not use it.

/*
 *	JSON_MEMORY_POOL Turns on libjson's iteraction with mempool++.  It is more efficient that simply
 *	connecting mempool++ to the callbacks because it integrates things internally and uses a number
 *	of memory pools.  This value tells libjson how large of a memory pool to start out with.  500KB 
 *	should suffice for most cases.  libjson will distribute that within the pool for the best
 *	performance depending on other settings.
 */

/*
 *  JSON_MUTEX_CALLBACKS exposes functions to register callbacks to lock and unlock
 *  mutexs and functions to lock and unlock JSONNodes and all of it's children.  This 
 *  does not prevent other threads from accessing the node, but will prevent them from
 *  locking it. It is much easier for the end programmer to allow libjson to manage
 *  your mutexs because of reference counting and manipulating trees, libjson automatically
 *  tracks mutex controls for you, so you only ever lock what you need to
 */
